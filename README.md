# Headless Concept

Please ensure you're using Node.js 7.10... it doesn't seem like 7.13 is working with puppeteer.

```
nvm install 7.10
nvm use 7.10
```

## Installation

This should do it:
```
npm install
node scraper.js
```

If that didn't work, just install the dependencies one by one:
```
npm install puppeteer mocha babel-core babel-cli
```
