# Headless Concept

Please ensure you're using Node.js 7.10. Puppeteer doesn't seem like Node 7.13.

```
nvm install 7.10
nvm use 7.10
```

## Installation

This should do it:
```npm install ```

If that didn't work, just install the dependencies one by one:
```npm install puppeteer mocha babel-core babel-cli```

## Usage
```node index.js```
